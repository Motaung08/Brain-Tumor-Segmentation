# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation

Medical imaging refers to a set of technologies designed to generate visual representations of the internal aspects of the human body in a non-invasive way. Medical imaging is intended to reveal internal organs that are hidden by skin and bones to analyze for abnormalities and diagnose and treat disease. The purpose of the project is to develop an automated supervised learning pneumonia diagnosis system that indicates whether a given chest X-ray image represents a patient with pneumonia. Detailed log can be found in the report.
